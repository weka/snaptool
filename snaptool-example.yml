# schedule syntax:
#
# every: 'month' | 'day' | list of months | list of days
#     if 'month' or list of months is provided:
#         snap occurs at at: <time> on day of month specified by day: <day of month 1-31>
#         day: defaults to 1, valid values: 1-31
#         list of months can be full month names or 3 letter abbreviation, comma separated list
#         if day of month is > number of days in a month, last day of the month is used
#             e.g. 31 will snap on the last day of every listed month
#    if 'day' or list of days is provided:
#         snap occurs at: <time>
#         if interval: is provided, potentially multiple snaps per day, see below
#         list of days can be full name or 3 letter abbreviation, comma separated list
#
# at:
#    first snap time of day.  Defaults to "0000" (midnight)
#    accepts times like "9am", "9:15am" "2300" etc
# retain:
#    is the number of snapshots kept, 0 disables schedule and removes all snapshots for the schedule
#    defaults to 4
# interval:
#    if interval: is not provided, single snapshot per day is taken at time specified by "at:"
#    if interval: is provided - uses at: and until: for time range of snaps
#       interval: is the number of minutes between snaps
#       first snap is taken at at: then every <interval:> minutes until until: is reached
# until:
#    only used when interval: is provided - this is the latest a snap can be taken during a day
#    defaults to "2359"
# day:
#    only used for 'month' or list of months, the day number of the month (1-31)
# upload:
#    valid options: yes, no, True, False, remote
#    defaults to no/False - no object store upload
#    yes/True uploads to local object store
#    remote uploads to remote object store  
#
# note that if multiple schedules conflict for the same filesystem and scheduled minute,
# only the schedule with the longest period between snaps will be taken
# (e.g. interval of 60 will be taken vs 15 min.   monthly will be taken vs daily.   etc.)
